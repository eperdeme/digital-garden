Ants need water all the time.  There was some debate by byFormica if ants can locate water in liquid feeders without assistance. They suggest adding a few drops of sunburst product to all water to aid discovery. The community however does not suggest this is necessary.

# Sugar

All ants except Messor require sugar and Messor can be given the option.

The "norm" is to use a sugar formula such as "byformica sunburst ant nectar", things to look out for are;

- Duration it can be in a liquid feeder
    - Some can be in liquid feeders for 10+days
- Does it need to be refrigerated
- Does it need diluting before use
